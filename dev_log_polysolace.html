								<h4>April 8th, 2020:</h4><span> A Ton of Additions</span>

							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									Poly Solace is coming along. I am taking a slight break right now from it to focus on classes. While initially on Spring break from college I had lots of free time to add stuff to the game, so here is just a list of additions.
									<ul>
										<li>3 new original tree models</li>
										<li>Original campfire model w/ particle effects</li>
										<li>Blowing leaves shader for trees and bushes</li>
										<li>WIP pause and settings menu</li>
										<li>WIP object placement system</li>
										<li>Added roaming cows and bunnies</li>
										<li>Day night cycle</li>
										<li>WIP skybox with the sun, stars, and moon</li>
										<li>Music system</li>
										<li>Post processing effects</li>
									</ul>
									Now that classes have started up again, I have taken a slight break from the game to focus on them a little more. Even though my classes are now online and we're told to stay at home for the quarantine, I find myself on the computer 
									for too long so I can't work on the game as much. I'd rather go outside while the day is nice and I don't have school work. The project is still going to be finished. I just need a slight break from it right now to just enjoy life.

								<h4>February 5th, 2020:</h4><span> Larger Terrain and a Main Menu</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									I have implemented a lot of new features since my last update. The map is now split into chunks so I can have larger maps in general(256 X 256). I have also created a little main menu to make it feel more like a game 
									at the moment. Finally, I added a very simple and crude user camera controller. The user can now use E and Q to rotate the map, use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out, and use W,A,S,D to move the camera. I still have a ton 
									of issues with the shaders, but that has been put off to the side for now. Currently, I am working on adding plants to the world. I am debating whether or not to procedurally generate the plants too, but I will get a working 
									layout of the spawning of the plants first.

								<h4>January 25th, 2020:</h4><span> Revamped Water and Terrain</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									With this update, I have significantly improved the runtime of the game! Through some quick searches online, it is possible to recreate the low-poly look through shaders. With this new information, I 
									got to work implementing a low-poly shader from mixing and mashing multiple tutorials online. With a shader, I am able to decrease the overall vector count for each mesh by basically half. The original way I 
									implemented the low-poly look was through doubling the vector count and not sharing any vectors for each mesh triangle (this tells the GPU whether or not to blend the colors or lighting effects). Now with a decreased vector count 
									I am able to drastically increase the size of the map and keep the performance up. As I was implementing this new low-poly shader for the terrain, I learned that I could actually displace the vectors through the shader itself also! 
									Now I can recreate the same water effect with just a single plane using this new low-poly water shader I created.
									<br></br>
									While creating the shaders, I wasn't able to recreate the original color scheme I had before. The terrain is a little too dark now and the water isn't exactly how I want it just yet either. This is what I will be working 
									on next.

								<h4>January 16th, 2020:</h4><span> Flat Shaded Terrain</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									Just a quick little update to the game. I added a flat shading "low-poly" look to the terrain generation. I love the low-poly look in games and really hope to bring that aesthetic to my game as much as 
									possible. Below is just a little comparison between the two different looks.

							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									While on break, I have found myself hardly working on this project and just enjoying my extra freetime while I have it. I have worked on this project from time to time when I got bored and implemented 
									a better looking terrain generator. I followed a couple youtube videos and did some personal modifications to what I already had to create the terrain generator. I am pretty happy with it at the moment and 
									wish to expand the size of it and make it more "low-poly" than it is now, but this is definitely a start.

								<h4>December 29th, 2019:</h4><span> Winter Break</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									I am currently on winter break for college and haven't had much of a drive to work on projects. It is nice to just relax after such a stressful semester. I have tons of free-time at the moment
									and when I am in the mood, I will eventually work on this project some more and add some new things. Currently, I was thinking of fleshing out the map generator and making it a more interesting 
									by adding different forms of noise to the map. I have found a way to implement a fall-off map to make the whole chunk of land into an island. I have run into the issue of the water being too 
									demanding on the game, so large maps are impossible to have at the moment. I might have to delve into multithreading again to get it to work on a larger scale.

								<h4>November 26th, 2019:</h4><span> Created a simple procedurally generated world</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									I was beginning to get tired of working in the 2D realm of game design. I have always loved the look of low poly games and how vibrant they can be, so I decided to take a shot a it myself.
									Since I seem to be jumping between different projects left and right, I am officially going to set a schedule for this project. I will spend a few hours a week or more on this project and actually finish it.
									The game currently stands at a point where you can randomly generate a chunk of low poly land with moving water. I am going to implement more realistic generation in terrain by fiddling around with the perlin noise.
									I would like to add: biomes, trees, animals, rivers, lakes, and small foliage. This game is going to be able building a nice little low poly world and watching it evolve over time.
