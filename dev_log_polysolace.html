								<p>
									While on break, I have found myself hardly working on this project and just enjoying my extra freetime while I have it. I have worked on this project from time to time when I got bored and implemented 
									a better looking terrain generator. I followed a couple youtube videos and did some personal modifications to what I already had to create the terrain generator. I am pretty happy with it at the moment and 
									wish to expand the size of it and make it more "low-poly" than it is now, but this is definitely a start.

								<h4>December 29th, 2019:</h4><span> Winter Break</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									I am currently on winter break for college and haven't had much of a drive to work on projects. It is nice to just relax after such a stressful semester. I have tons of free-time at the moment
									and when I am in the mood, I will eventually work on this project some more and add some new things. Currently, I was thinking of fleshing out the map generator and making it a more interesting 
									by adding different forms of noise to the map. I have found a way to implement a fall-off map to make the whole chunk of land into an island. I have run into the issue of the water being too 
									demanding on the game, so large maps are impossible to have at the moment. I might have to delve into multithreading again to get it to work on a larger scale.

								<h4>November 26th, 2019:</h4><span> Created a simple procedurally generated world</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									I was beginning to get tired of working in the 2D realm of game design. I have always loved the look of low poly games and how vibrant they can be, so I decided to take a shot a it myself.
									Since I seem to be jumping between different projects left and right, I am officially going to set a schedule for this project. I will spend a few hours a week or more on this project and actually finish it.
									The game currently stands at a point where you can randomly generate a chunk of low poly land with moving water. I am going to implement more realistic generation in terrain by fiddling around with the perlin noise.
									I would like to add: biomes, trees, animals, rivers, lakes, and small foliage. This game is going to be able building a nice little low poly world and watching it evolve over time.
