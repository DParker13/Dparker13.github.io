								<h4>September 9th, 2019:</h4><span> Taking a Break</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									So, as the title of the dev log suggests, <b>I am taking a break from this project</b>. Summer has ended and I am <b>back at school</b> trying my best to focus on classes.
									I have put this project on hold because it requires so much time to actually implement new ideas now. I have <b>moved my focus to the <a href="project_marble.html">marble project</a></b> because it is a 
									<b>simpler project to work on and off of when I have the time</b>. I'll update this page when I start this project back up, but I will be updating the <a href="dev_log_marble.html">marble dev log</a> for right now.

								<h4>July 3rd, 2019:</h4><span> Temporary Character Model and Animations</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									Today, I have <b>finished a rough version of the character walking animations</b>. I am currently <b>using temporary character sprites from Stardew Valley</b> to just quickly <b>test out how the animations look</b>.
									<b>Tranquility is heavily inspired from Stardew Valley and I'm now realizing how extremely similar my art is to Stardew Valley</b>. I <b>don't want Tranquility to be known as a Stardew Valley clone</b> in the end. I <b>want my game to have
									its own personality from others</b>. This recent realization is making <b>want to completely change the art style</b> of the entire game. I still <b>want a pixel feel</b> to the game, but my art skills are lacking a little.
									I have <b>trouble creating art from scratch and prefer using references</b>, and making my art <b>look extremely realistic to the original photo</b>. My idea was to <b>take pictures of items, isolate them with a greenscreen,
									and shink the photos down in size to pixelate them</b>. This way, <b>Tranquility will be even more genuine and realistic than other similar games</b>.

								<h4>July 2nd, 2019:</h4><span> Multithreading COMPLETE</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									The day has finally come, and it was a lot quicker than I expected. I managed to <b>throw the whole chunk generator on a separate background thread</b>. The game runs a million times better because of this significant change.
									What I managed to do was <b>calculate all of the necessary chunk data on the separate thread, add the data to a queue, and then wait for the main thread to dequeue the updated chunk info and just simply activate or deactivate the chunk</b>.
									This <b>allows for all the heavy calculates to run in the background</b> of the game to keep things running smoothly up front on the main thread. Tranquility <b>now runs at a smoothish 60+ fps even while loading chunks</b>.
									The game still has a few hick-ups here and there obviously, but I will work them out at a later date. I also <b>had to disable the plants and trees for the map generation at the moment</b>. I am not happy with the current look
									of the trees and <b>wish to change the look of them</b>.

								<h4>May 31st, 2019:</h4><span> Multithreading</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									I have been <b>working on the project here and there</b> trying to implement some multithreading. At the moment, I have <b>implemented some extremely rough code that utilizes multithreading.</b>
									The game currently <b>lags even more because of the recent implementation!</b> However, this is <b>because of my poorly optimized code</b> behind the multithreading.
									With a <b>little more time and better optimization, the multithreading should run as intended</b> and actually speed up performance on the game.
									Right now, <b>the game opens and reads files on a separate thread</b>, the issue lies with how I receive the information from the separate thread I believe.
									The <b>game runs the separate loading thread</b>, then it <b>waits to receive the chunks</b> from that thread, this is where the <b>game freezes up for a few seconds</b>.
									Either this is the issue, or I might have to find a way to also fully load and generate the chunks while on a separate thread. I'll figure it out eventually.

								<h4>May 25th, 2019:</h4><span> Loading Chunks From File</span>
							</div>
							<div class="dev-body">
								<p>
									This marks the <b>beginning</b> of the Tranquility development log! I have been working here and there on the project messing with the map generator code improving it every way possible. 
									I have <b>successfully added the ability for the chunks to be saved into separate files, then reloaded into the world as it generates if a save file exists!</b> 
									However, I learned the action of loading a chunk from a file is extremely processing heavy, and the <b>game lags significantly when it loads chunks from file</b> instead of generating a new one. 
									So, I used my Googling skills and might have figured out a solution, <b>Multithreading!</b> I learned that I might be able to create a new thread that runs along with the main thread. 
									The <b>newly created thread will process the loading and saving (maybe even full generation) of the chunks separately from the main thread</b>, meaning that there will be little to no lag from loading chunks from a file. 
									The issue right now is that I have no idea how to do multithreading so that is my next big hurdle at the moment.
